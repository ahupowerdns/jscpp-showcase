==============

The waters are safe again for C++ folks to touch the web. 

Years ago we tried PHP and sure enough, whipped up some passable sites
quickly enough.  Then we realized the horror of what we had done and left in
disgust.

With the advent of powerful JavaScript libraries, the coming of age of
JavaScript performance and support, plus the growth of Json/JsonP as a
data-interchange standard, all of a sudden the web is a great place for us
C++ dinosaurs to be.

This small demo project shows:
	
	* How to safely expose data from your C++ application over HTTP and
	  JSON
	* How to safely process data your C++ application that arrives over
	  HTTP and JSON
	* How to interact with your application from JavaScript
	* How to make this look (reasonably) good

Nice book for people with a C++ background:
